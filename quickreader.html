                            ...So! The SolarNet is banning users who read my posts! Hehehehe. The Solar Union knows they can't find me out here, so they want to aggravate my Listener-sans instead!<br/><br/>Listener-san, don't be sad if you got B& T_T. We've still got the freeNet ^_~*! Plus I know I have a lot of Listener-sans no matter what. Thank you for not giving up on me! And before you ask, I don't care if the Solar Union reads this. I mean, what can they do? Haha!<br/><br/>
    ...To those back home: Remember, don't believe anything you hear, no matter how official or scientific it sounds. The media is fake too. The people the press says are bad, are actually good. The solar system was NOT contacted by aliens. Ever. Remember that!

                            ...Weirrrd huh? At least this is what the data looked like before it was "improved" right after the "Keplarians" "contacted" us 9 years ago. Yup! They tried to hide it but I have the data. There's a lot more where this comes from.<br/>
